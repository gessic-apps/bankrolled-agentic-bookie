    "finalOutput": "Based on our review of all current markets and the most recent data/tools available, here is our decision and rationale:\n\n1. Market 0x5fcbe6cFf0E3f1bCaD41bE457dC7cfB84684B01E (Atl\u00e9tico Madrid vs Valladolid):  \n\u2003\u2022 The Monte Carlo simulation showed critical risk (high exposure risk and variance) with a projected 95th percentile exposure near $3913.23, well above our max of $2000.  \n\u2003\u2022 We added liquidity (amount: 2695) as recommended and updated the odds slightly (increasing home odds from 1.1 up to 1.15 and adjusting away and spread odds) to discourage excess home bets and rebalance market action.\n\n2. Market 0x1711CEF669a4D8E4F996E86DdB490F74343031c6 (Orlando Magic vs Atlanta Hawks):  \n\u2003\u2022 Monte Carlo simulation showed a critical state with an expected 95th percentile exposure of approximately $2975.79.  \n\u2003\u2022 We added liquidity of 1570 as recommended to cover the gap between current max exposure and the simulation projection.  \n\u2003\u2022 An attempt to update exposure limits (setting both home and away moneyline limits to 1000) ran into a nonce error. This will require retrying, but immediate liquidity addition helps mitigate risk.\n\n3. Market 0x8882d09abDDa2285FAdcC6F8AFcd618f078a600D (Napoli vs Empoli):  \n\u2003\u2022 We updated risk limits by setting the home moneyline exposure limit to 500. This update is aimed at curbing potential overbetting on the favored side and controlling risk exposure.\n\n4. Markets 0xCF88A50b65576796Fd791f3D1752C035eccc6933 (Bournemouth vs Fulham), 0x068b875c769F5A54fC43022689E5442c033AB8BD (Aston Villa vs PSG), and 0x2626035A31CbD2520d0076bBBa7D0c7fD6ed5D25 (Borussia Dortmund vs Barcelona):  \n\u2003\u2022 These markets currently show no significant imbalance or high exposure (with zero current exposure noted) and appear to be well balanced.  \n\u2003\u2022 As a result, no changes to odds or exposure limits were implemented in these markets.\n\nIn summary, for the riskier markets we used Monte Carlo simulation to drive our decisions \u2013 adding liquidity where necessary and adjusting odds to minimize potential losses. We also set targeted exposure limits (e.g., for Napoli vs. Empoli) to help manage our risk profile. For the balanced markets, no adjustments were needed at this stage.\n\nThese final actions are recorded in our actions file with risk_controlled set to true where we are managing the market and false where odds updates remain the responsibility of the odds manager."
